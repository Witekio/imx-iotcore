Test Keys: NO SECURITY!
===========

This directory contains keys that are used to sign the reference firmware binaries checked in to imx-iotcore. These are for **TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT ONLY** and do not provide any security. These keys are provided so that you can test security features of the reference firmware, and continue to build and sign your own firmware after you've fused your board. You must generate your own keys if you plan to ship a product.
